# Circuit-Simulator-3D-Unity
This is a 3D circuit simulator made by Daniel Holzknecht in Unity.

# Functionality:
Click on any of the white squares or the battery connections and a wire will be created between the metal and the mouse position. 
Click on a different metal to finish creating the wire.
The inspector on the right-hand side of the screen will give you information about the currently selected element.

# Controls:
- Tab-Key: 
    - switch between creating a Wire, Resistor and LED.
- Spacebar: 
    - simulate the circuit.
- Left-Shift-Key: 
    - toggle between highlighting the connected wires or not
- Right-Mouse-Button: 
    - when creating an element: cancel the process of creating an element (click)
    - when the battery/breadboard is selected: rotate the element (click)
    - otherwise the camera will be moved (hold)
- Middle-Mouse-Button:
    - rotating the camera around its origin
    
# Note:
This program is far from being finished and may still have some bugs. But since I now move on the other projects, I am not going to work on this for any longer.
Maybe i will come back to this project in the future.
