Todo:
[x] change color of components when hovering
[x] draw line to mouse when clicking on a metal
[x] cancel on right click
[x] make inputs of breadboard as cubes (for now)
[x] if the battery moves, make the wire move too
[x] wires can be created in the breadboard
[x] wire has multiple vertices, quadratic bezier curve
[x] when wire is following the mouse, it should stay at one height
[x] when creating a wire, attach it to its gameobject
[x] update the wires when rotating a component and before attaching a wire to an object
[x] functionality to select a wire and highlight it
[x] delete a wire that is selected by pressing the delete-button
[x] breadboard can be created in script with parameters
[x] battery can be created in script 
[x] all connected wires get reached in an algorithm
[x] get connections from one metal strip to another and to battery working
[x] change color of led if circuit is complete
[x] be able to remove the middle point of a wire so that its not a curve anymore
[?] be able to move one end of wire around if its selected
[ ] be able to move wires into a certain position
[x] can click on a wire and select it
[ ] different types of batteries
[ ] calculate mA whenever a resistor is being placed 
[x] change the height of the middle point of a wire by clicking on the wire and dragging it
[x] make an led in blender
[x] can make LEDs instead of wires (switch with tab-key)
[ ] can select a LED and delete it
[ ] different math formula for led wires
[ ] when selecting one wire of an led, both get selected
[x] update led position and rotation when moving a component

Bugs:
[?] problems with object color when dragging the object and releasing it
[x] check if the new wire doesnt already exist
[x] immediately makes a new wire when pressing mousebutton left to finish the last one
[x] plane can be moved
[x] apparently no tag on parent object when creating a wire
[x] points are buggy when creating a wire 
[x] wire can be attached to its own gameobject
[x] somehow its always kind of a double click
[ ] metal can appear highlighted after cancelling making of wire
[x] plane material and sky are not how they should be
[x] after unselecting a wire its color should be the same as before
[ ] color of wire is wrong after its made flat
[x] cant drag component properly
[x] LED is on the wrong position when moving the mouse
[x] rotation of the led doesnt work right
[x] cant connect an led with a metal
[x] normal wire is still selected while making a new led

Optimization:
[x] only move component if delta is not zero
[n] maybe make UpdateWiresPosition() more efficient 
[ ] maybe make WireAlreadyExists() more efficient
[x] do i need the list verticesOfWire
[x] Wire class needs its own file
[ ] canClickThisFrame is inefficient since its value is set in Update()
[x] code clear up wireManager and MouseInteraction
