Todo:
[x] change color of components when hovering
[x] draw line to mouse when clicking on a metal
[x] cancel on right click
[x] make inputs of breadboard as cubes (for now)
[x] if the battery moves, make the wire move too
[x] wires can be created in the breadboard
[x] wire has multiple vertices, quadratic bezier curve
[x] when wire is following the mouse, it should stay at one height
[x] when creating a wire, attach it to its gameobject
[x] update the wires when rotating a component and before attaching a wire to an object
[x] functionality to select a wire and highlight it
[x] delete a wire that is selected by pressing the delete-button
[x] breadboard can be created in script with parameters
[x] battery can be created in script 
[x] all connected wires get reached in an algorithm
[x] get connections from one metal strip to another and to battery working
[x] change color of led if circuit is complete
[x] be able to remove the middle point of a wire so that its not a curve anymore
[ ] be able to move one end of wire around if its selected
[ ] be able to move wires into a certain position
[x] can click on a wire and select it
[ ] different types of batteries
[x] introduce more properties for resistor, led, and battery
[x] make the current flow in the right direction, change the algorithm
[ ] calculate mA before making LEDs glow
[x] change the height of the middle point of a wire by clicking on the wire and dragging it
[x] make an led in blender
[x] can make LEDs instead of wires (switch with tab-key)
[x] can select an LED and delete it
[x] can move led up and down
[x] update led position and rotation when moving a component
[x] can move and rotate a component and led position and wires position update
[x] highlight the metals the selected wire is attached to
[ ] different math formula for led wires ? 
[ ] when selecting one wire of an led, both get selected ?
[x] make led glow only if the circuit is complete and its connected to the circuit
[x] make a resistor in blender and make it spawnable
[x] different wire color/thickness for the resistor
[x] when clicking the space bar, toggle wire colors to see the electricity path
[#] nodal analysis
[x] 1. find all nodes
[x] 2. set the ground node and the node connected to the positive side of the battery
[x] 3. mark the unknown nodes (maybe bool known = false) 
[x] 4. get the neighbor nodes of each node
[ ] calculating the voltages of nodes using nodal analysis

Bugs:
[?] problems with object color when dragging the object and releasing it
[x] check if the new wire doesnt already exist
[x] immediately makes a new wire when pressing mousebutton left to finish the last one
[x] plane can be moved
[x] apparently no tag on parent object when creating a wire
[x] points are buggy when creating a wire 
[x] wire can be attached to its own gameobject
[x] somehow its always kind of a double click
[ ] metal can appear highlighted after cancelling making of wire
[x] plane material and sky are not how they should be
[x] after unselecting a wire its color should be the same as before
[x] cant drag component properly
[x] LED is on the wrong position when moving the mouse
[x] rotation of the led doesnt work right
[x] cant connect an led with a metal
[x] normal wire is still selected while making a new led
[x] cant move component (error with linerenderer)  #? cant reproduce
[x] when creating a wire the y-position is not correct (CreateLineObject())
[x] metals are still highlighted after a wire gets deleted
[x] start and end object of an item can be the same
[ ] when making wire flat, both ends have a different thickness

Optimization:
[x] only move component if delta is not zero
[x] maybe make UpdateWiresPosition() more efficient 
[x] find the wire/item when clicking on a wire/item to select it more efficiently
[x] do i need the list verticesOfWire
[x] Wire class needs its own file
[x] code clear up wireManager and MouseInteraction
[x] transform LED class to item class
[x] make led glow and other stuff (materials, spawn position, shadows)
[x] find item when deleting a wire that is attached to an item faster
[x] connect wires to the top of the metal so its easier to see where the wire is connected
[x] make resistor look better
[x] swap positive and negative of the battery, because the electrons go from negative to positive
[x] resistors dont have polarity
[x] spawn resistors with a lower y value
