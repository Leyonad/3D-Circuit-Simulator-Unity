Todo:
[x] change color of components when hovering
[x] draw line to mouse when clicking on a metal
[x] cancel on right click
[x] make inputs of breadboard as cubes (for now)
[x] if the battery moves, make the wire move too
[x] wires can be created in the breadboard
[x] wire has multiple vertices, quadratic bezier curve
[x] when wire is following the mouse, it should stay at one height
[x] when creating a wire, attach it to its gameobject
[x] update the wires when rotating a component and before attaching a wire to an object
[x] functionality to select a wire and highlight it
[x] delete a wire that is selected by pressing the delete-button
[x] breadboard can be created in script with parameters
[x] battery can be created in script 
[ ] different types of batteries
[x] all connected wires get reached in an algorithm
[x] get connections from one metal strip to another and to battery working
[ ] can click on a wire and select it
[ ] calculate mA whenever a resistor is being placed 

Bugs:
[?] problems with object color when dragging the object and releasing it
[x] check if the new wire doesnt already exist
[x] immediately makes a new wire when pressing mousebutton left to finish the last one
[x] plane can be moved
[x] apparently no tag on parent object when creating a wire
[x] points are buggy when creating a wire 
[x] wire can be attached to its own gameobject
[?] somehow its always kind of a double click
[ ] metal can appear highlighted after cancelling making of wire
[x] plane material and sky are not how they should be

Optimization:
[x] only move component if delta is not zero
[ ] maybe make UpdateWiresPosition() more efficient 
[ ] maybe make WireAlreadyExists() more efficient
[x] do i need the list verticesOfWire
[x] Wire class needs its own file
